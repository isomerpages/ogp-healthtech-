<h3>See a GP if you experience the following:</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Vomiting is mild and still able to tolerate some feeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See a gynaecologist if you are known to be pregnant (Some Emergency Department
such as Sengkang Hospital and Changi General Hospital does not have an
on-site Gynaecologist and you may need to be transferred to another hospital)</p>
</li>
</ol>
