<h3>Go to the Emergency Department or Urgent Care Centre if you experience the following:</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The bleeding does not stop after 20-30 minutes of continuous pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bleeding is very heavy. If you're losing a large amount of blood,
or the blood is pouring down the back of your throat, you should go to
the ED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nosebleed started after a serious injury. This includes a blow to
the head, a car accident, or a suspected broken nose. This could be a sign
of a more severe internal injury.
<br>You are having difficulty breathing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You feel weak, dizzy, or faint. These can be signs of significant blood
loss.</p>
</li>
</ol>
