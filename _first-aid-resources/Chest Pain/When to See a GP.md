<h3><strong>See a GP if you experience the following: </strong></h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Dull, achy, or sharp chest pain that is linked to a specific activity
and resolves with rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persistent chest pain that is not severe, and you're confident it's not
a heart attack (e.g., you suspect it's musculoskeletal pain, heartburn,
or a cough).</p>
</li>
</ol>
