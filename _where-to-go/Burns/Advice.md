<h3>Immediate First Aid for Minor Burns (First- and Second-Degree)</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Minor burns are characterized by red, painful skin (first-degree) or blisters
(second-degree). These can often be managed at home.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cool the Burn:</strong> The most critical first step is to immediately
cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 10 to 20 minutes.
This helps to reduce swelling, ease pain, and prevent the burn from spreading
deeper into the skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not use ice or ice-cold water</strong>, as this can cause further
tissue damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not apply butter, oil, ointments or toothpaste</strong> to the
burn, as these can trap heat and increase the risk of infection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remove Jewelry or Tight Clothing:</strong> Gently remove any rings,
bracelets, or tight clothing from the affected area before swelling begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cover the Burn:</strong> After cooling, gently cover the burn with
a clean, non-stick bandage or a sterile cloth. This protects the area from
infection and helps reduce pain by keeping air off the burn.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not pop any blisters</strong>, as the skin over the blister
provides a natural barrier against infection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider Pain Relief:</strong> For pain, over-the-counter pain
relievers like ibuprofen or paracetamol can be taken.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3>When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A burn is a medical emergency in certain situations. <strong>Go to the nearest emergency room or call for an ambulance immediately if:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The burn is large and covers a major part of the body,</strong> such
as the hands, feet, face, groin, or a major joint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The burn is a third-degree burn.</strong> Third-degree burns look
leathery and charred, and the skin may be white, brown, or black. The nerve
endings are often destroyed, so there may be no pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The burn is caused by chemicals or electricity.</strong> These
burns can be very deep and may not show their full extent on the surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The burn is accompanied by other injuries,</strong> such as smoke
inhalation or a broken bone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The person is a young child, elderly, or has a compromised immune system.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There are signs of infection,</strong> such as increased redness,
swelling, warmth, pus, or a foul odor coming from the burn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You are unsure of the burn's severity.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>What Not to Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't apply ice.</strong> This can cause a burn and further damage
tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't apply creams, lotions, butter, powders or toothpaste</strong> to
a fresh burn. These can trap heat and increase the risk of infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't pop blisters.</strong> The fluid and skin of a blister protect
the underlying tissue from infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't remove clothing that is stuck to the burn.</strong> This
can tear the skin and cause more damage. Cut around the clothing instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't use cotton balls</strong> or other fuzzy materials on the
burn, as the fibers can get stuck in the wound.</p>
</li>
</ul>
