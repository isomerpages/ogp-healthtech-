<h2>Diarrhoea</h2>
<h3>Immediate and Short-Term Relief</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> This is the most important tip. Diarrhea
causes your body to lose a significant amount of water and electrolytes.
Drink plenty of clear liquids like water, broth, or electrolyte-rich drinks.
Avoid sugary drinks, fruit juices, and alcohol, as they can worsen dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid Trigger Foods:</strong> Steer clear of foods that can irritate
your digestive system, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fatty and fried foods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spicy foods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-fiber foods like whole grains and certain vegetables</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-Term and Preventive Tips</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify and Avoid Triggers:</strong> Keep a food diary to help
pinpoint specific foods that trigger your diarrhea. Common culprits include
caffeine, artificial sweeteners, and certain types of carbohydrates (FODMAPs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> The gut-brain connection is powerful. Stress
can significantly impact your digestive system. Incorporate stress-management
techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises into your
daily routine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice Good Hygiene:</strong> To prevent infectious diarrhea,
wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the bathroom,
before eating, and after handling raw meat.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to See a Doctor</h3>
<p></p>
<p>While most cases of diarrhea are mild and resolve on their own, you should
seek medical attention if you experience any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Signs of severe dehydration:</strong> This includes urinating less
frequently, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, and having a very dry mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diarrhea lasting more than 2 days in adults</strong> or more than
24 hours in children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Severe abdominal or rectal pain.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever of 102°F (38.9°C) or higher.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Black, tarry, or bloody stools.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
