<h3>See a GP if you experience the following:</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You have frequent nosebleeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are taking blood-thinning medication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have a known blood clotting disorder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bleeding eventually stops, but you have concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you experience symptoms of anemia (like heart palpitations, shortness
of breath, and pale skin) or if you notice unusual bruising, this could
be related to an underlying condition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
