<h4><strong><u>When to go to the Emergency Department</u></strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The bleeding does not stop after 20-30 minutes of continuous pressure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bleeding is very heavy. If you're losing a large amount of blood,
or the blood is pouring down the back of your throat, you should go to
the ED.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nosebleed started after a serious injury. This includes a blow to
the head, a car accident, or a suspected broken nose. This could be a sign
of a more severe internal injury.</p>
<p>You are having difficulty breathing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You feel weak, dizzy, or faint. These can be signs of significant blood
loss.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong><u>When to See a GP</u></strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>You have frequent nosebleeds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You are taking blood-thinning medication</p>
<p></p>
<p>You have a known blood clotting disorder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bleeding eventually stops, but you have concerns.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you experience symptoms of anemia (like heart palpitations, shortness
of breath, and pale skin) or if you notice unusual bruising, this could
be related to an underlying condition.</p>
