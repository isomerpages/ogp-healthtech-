<h3>1. Immediate Soothing and Self-Care</h3>
<p></p>
<p>These tips are for providing temporary relief for mild to moderate ear
pain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply a Warm Compress:</strong> Place a warm (not hot) washcloth
or a heating pad on the outer ear. The heat can help soothe the pain and
relax the muscles in the area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers:</strong> Medications like
ibuprofen or Paracetamol can help reduce both pain and inflammation. Be
sure to follow the dosage instructions on the package. <strong>Note:</strong> Do
not use aspirin for children or teenagers with a fever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drinking plenty of fluids can help thin
mucus and encourage it to drain, which can relieve pressure in the middle
ear if the pain is related to a cold or sinus infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elevate Your Head:</strong> When lying down, use extra pillows
to elevate your head. This can help promote drainage from the eustachian
tubes and reduce pressure in the ear.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
