<h1><strong>Chest Pain</strong></h1>
<p>Chest pain is a common symptom with many possible causes, and not all
of them are related to the heart. However, because chest pain can be a
sign of a life-threatening heart attack, it is crucial to take it seriously.
Here is some practical advice on what to monitor and when to seek medical
attention.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Understanding the Signs and Symptoms</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Heart attack symptoms can vary and may not always present as sudden, crushing
chest pain. It's important to be aware of the full range of potential symptoms,
including those that can be more subtle.</p>
<p><strong>Common Heart Attack Symptoms:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chest Pain or Discomfort:</strong> This is the most common symptom.
It can feel like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or fullness sensation
in the center or left side of your chest. The discomfort may last for more
than a few minutes, or it may go away and come back.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pain Radiating to Other Areas:</strong> The pain or discomfort
can spread to the jaw, neck, back, or one or both arms (often the left
arm).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shortness of Breath:</strong> You may have difficulty breathing
or feel like you can't get enough air. This can occur with or without chest
discomfort.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other Symptoms:</strong> These can include cold sweats, fatigue,
lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations for Monitoring:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Changes in Your Pain:</strong> Pay close attention to any changes
in the nature of your chest pain. For example, if it becomes more frequent,
more intense, or lasts longer than usual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pain with Exertion:</strong> A key indicator of a heart-related
issue is chest pain or discomfort that occurs during physical activity
(like walking up stairs) and resolves with rest. If you notice this pattern,
it's a significant warning sign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Associated Symptoms:</strong> Be mindful of whether your chest
pain is accompanied by any of the other classic heart attack symptoms,
such as shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness. The presence
of these additional symptoms, even without severe chest pain, can be a
red flag.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Important things to note: Do not drive yourself to the hospital, even if you are not coming in by ambulance. Highlight to the registration counter in the Emergency Department that your primary problem is chest pain, such that an ECG (heart tracing) is done early for you.</em>
</p>

<h3>General Advice</h3>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no perfect test that can exclude a heart attack event in the
future, 100%. Tests may predict a low risk of heart attack of less than
0.1% chance. However, it is important to take active steps to reduce the
risk of heart attack by taking healthy and preventive measures.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If you are already on medications for previous heart attack such as blood
thinners, be compliant to the medications on a daily basis. Sudden discontinuation
of medications without medical advice may lead to a heart attack in the
long run, if not in the near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visit your neighborhood GP to enroll in healthier SG screening and check
your cholesterol levels and for diabetes screening. These are covered by
GP subsidy and are not done routinely in the emergency department</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your cholesterol is high and has been advised by your GP to consume
medications, do be compliant to the medications. The preventive benefits
will not be immediately apparent but they will help to reduce the risk
of a heart attack or stroke in the future. Modify your diet to a low fat,
low sodium diet may also help to reduce cholesterol and hypertension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoking Cessation is an important step to prevent heart attack. Smoking
less does not help to reduce the risk as much as compared to complete cessation.
Your GP may have the tools to help you to quit smoking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaping is not a safe alternative to smoking. The risks of heart attack
from vaping is higher than smoking, if not the same.</p>
</li>
