<h2>Headache</h2>
<h3>Immediate Relief for a Headache</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rest in a Quiet, Dark Room:</strong> Lie down in a comfortable
position away from bright lights and loud noises. Light and sound sensitivity
are common with headaches and can make the pain worse.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply a Cold or Warm Compress:</strong> For a tension headache,
a warm compress on your neck or forehead can relax muscles. For a migraine,
a cold pack on your forehead, temples, or the back of your neck can numb
the area and dull the pain.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drink Water:</strong> Dehydration is a common trigger for headaches.
Sip on some water slowly. A sports drink can help if the headache is caused
by electrolyte imbalance.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Over-the-Counter (OTC) Pain Relievers:</strong> Medications like
ibuprofen, naproxen (NSAIDs), or acetaminophen can be effective for managing
headache pain. Take them as soon as you feel a headache coming on, following
the instructions on the package.</p>
<p></p>

</ul>

<h3>Lifestyle and Long-Term Prevention</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify and Avoid Triggers:</strong> Keep a headache diary to
track potential triggers, such as certain foods (e.g., aged cheeses, processed
meats), lack of sleep, or specific smells. Once you identify a pattern,
you can try to avoid those triggers.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize Sleep:</strong> Stick to a regular sleep schedule, even
on weekends. Lack of sleep and oversleeping can both trigger headaches.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Stress is a major cause of tension headaches.
Incorporate stress-management techniques into your daily routine, such
as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eat Regular Meals:</strong> Skipping meals can lead to a drop in
blood sugar, which may cause a headache. Try to eat regular, balanced meals
to keep your blood sugar stable.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to See a Doctor</h3>
<p></p>
<p>While most headaches are not serious, it is important to seek medical
advice if:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your headache is sudden and severe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The headache is accompanied by a fever, stiff neck, rash, confusion, or
seizures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You experience a headache after a head injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The headache is a new type of pain you haven't experienced before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your headaches are persistent, recurring, or getting worse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
