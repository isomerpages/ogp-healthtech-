<h2>Fever</h2>
<p>Fever is a temporary increase in your body's temperature, often as a result
of an illness. It's a sign that your body is fighting an infection. While
a fever can be uncomfortable, it is usually not dangerous and can be managed
with practical, at-home care.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some practical tips to manage a fever, organized by immediate
actions and when to seek medical attention.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Immediate Self-Care Tips</h3>
<p></p>
<p>These steps are designed to help you feel more comfortable while your
body works to fight the underlying cause of the fever.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Rest:</strong> The most important thing you can do is rest. Your
body needs energy to fight the infection, so avoid strenuous activity.
Stay home from work or school to prevent the spread of illness and allow
yourself to recover.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Fever can cause you to lose fluids through
sweating. Dehydration can worsen symptoms and make you feel sicker.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Drink plenty of clear fluids,</strong> such as water, broth, and
electrolyte-rich sports drinks.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid sugary drinks and alcohol,</strong> as these can be dehydrating.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dress Lightly and Use a Light Blanket:</strong> Over-bundling can
trap heat and cause your temperature to rise. Wear light, breathable clothing
and use a light blanket if you feel chilled.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Try a Lukewarm Bath or Sponge Bath:</strong> A lukewarm bath can
help bring your body temperature down and provide some comfort. Avoid cold
water, as it can cause shivering, which can actually increase your body
temperature.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Over-the-Counter Medications:</strong> Medications can help
reduce fever and relieve body aches.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Paracetamol:</strong> A common choice for fever reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ibuprofen (Nurofen):</strong> An NSAID that reduces fever and inflammation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Always follow the dosage instructions</strong> on the package and
consult a pharmacist or doctor if you have questions, especially if you
have other medical conditions or are taking other medications.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a Cool Compress:</strong> Place a cool, damp washcloth on your
forehead or wrists to help you feel more comfortable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>When to Seek Medical Attention</h3>
<p></p>
<p>While most fevers resolve on their own, certain signs indicate a need
for professional medical help.</p>
<p><strong>Contact your doctor or seek urgent medical care if you or your child experience:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever above 103째F (39.4째C)</strong> in adults, or <strong>104째F (40째C)</strong> in
children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever lasting more than 3 days</strong> in adults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever in an infant younger than 3 months old.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever accompanied by a severe headache,</strong> neck stiffness,
or rash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever with a seizure.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever with confusion or unusual irritability.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever with a sore throat, ear pain, or persistent vomiting.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever with severe abdominal pain.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, fever is a symptom, not a disease. Managing the fever will help
you feel better, but addressing the underlying cause of the illness is
key to full recovery</p>
