<h2>Back Pain</h2>
<p>Back pain is one of the most common medical complaints. For patients,
back pain can be frightening and lead to a cycle of fear, inactivity, and
worsening pain. MRI is very often not the solution to solve the back pain.
A period of conservative management such as physiotherapy is the first
line treatment course, provided there are no red flag symptoms.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>After your doctor has seen and determined that there are no red flag symptoms
for your back pain, the first and most important step is to alleviate fear.
Many patients with back pain worry about a serious underlying condition,
such as a "slipped disc," permanent damage, or the need for surgery.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the vast majority of cases, back pain is "non-specific," meaning it
is not caused by a serious disease or structural damage. Just like a sprained
ankle, it is painful and requires care, but it heals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The spine is an incredibly strong and resilient structure. Back pain is
rarely a sign of serious harm and that the body has a remarkable ability
to heal itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most acute back pain episodes resolve within a few weeks. Having a medication
regime that provides round-the-clock relief during the initial recovery
process will help prevent surges of pain.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>General Advice</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay Active:</strong> Stay as active as possible and to return
to their normal daily activities as soon as they are able. The goal is
to move, even if it's uncomfortable at first. Prolonged bed rest can actually
make back pain worse by deconditioning muscles and increasing stiffness.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with Gentle Movement:</strong> Suggest gentle exercises like
walking, swimming, or cycling. These activities can help reduce stiffness,
strengthen core muscles, and improve blood flow without putting excessive
strain on the spine.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Encourage the patient to "listen
to their body" and pace themselves. Pain during movement doesn't necessarily
mean they are causing harm. They should start slow and gradually increase
the duration and intensity of their activity.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empower </strong>yourself by using the following tools at home
to manage your pain:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Heat or Cold Therapy:</strong> A cold pack (ice) is often best
for the first 48 hours to reduce inflammation, while a hot pack can help
soothe sore, tight muscles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simple Stretches:</strong> Teach a few simple, safe stretches that
can help relieve tension. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Knee-to-Chest Stretch:</strong> Lying on your back, pull one knee
at a time towards your chest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gentle Rotational Stretches:</strong> Lying on your back with knees
bent, slowly roll your knees from side to side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers:</strong> Discuss the appropriate
use of medications like NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) or Paracetamol to help
manage pain and allow for more movement. These medications are for short-term
use and not a long-term solution.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Lifestyle Factors</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Provide advice on proper sitting and standing
posture, especially for those with desk jobs. Suggest taking regular breaks
to stand, stretch, and move around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifting:</strong> Teach proper lifting techniques—bending at the
knees and keeping the back straight—to reduce the risk of future injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Excess weight, particularly around
the abdomen, puts extra strain on the spine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smoking Cessation:</strong> Smoking can reduce blood flow to the
discs in the spine, which can slow healing and contribute to chronic pain.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Monitoring for red flags</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> A follow-up appointment is scheduled with the
polyclinic or the orthopedic spine specialist to check on your progress
and reinforce the self-management strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Red Flags" for Back Pain:</strong> Serious symptoms that warrant
immediate medical attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of bladder or bowel control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back pain that occurs after a fall or serious injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back pain accompanied by fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sudden, severe pain that does not improve with rest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
