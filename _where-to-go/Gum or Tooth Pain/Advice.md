<h3>1. Immediate Relief and Self-Care</h3>
<p></p>
<p>These tips can help provide temporary comfort while you seek professional
care.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rinse with Warm Salt Water:</strong> A simple and effective remedy.
Mix about half a teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water and swish
it around your mouth. The saltwater rinse can help reduce swelling and
clean the area around the affected tooth or gum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply a Cold Compress:</strong> If the pain is accompanied by swelling
on your face or jaw, apply a cold pack or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped
in a towel to the outside of your cheek for 15-20 minutes at a time. This
can help numb the area and reduce inflammation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers:</strong> Medications like
ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAID) or paracetamol
can help manage the pain. Follow the dosage instructions on the package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid Irritants:</strong> Steer clear of very hot or very cold
foods and drinks, as they can worsen the pain, especially if you have a
cavity or exposed nerve.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>2. What to Avoid and Oral Hygiene Tips</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do Not Put Aspirin Directly on the Tooth or Gum:</strong> This
is a common but harmful myth. Placing aspirin against the gum can cause
a chemical burn and damage the soft tissue, without providing any pain
relief to the tooth itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid Hard or Sugary Foods:</strong> Chewing on hard foods can
further aggravate a sensitive tooth. Sugary and acidic foods can also worsen
pain, especially if the tooth has decay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gently Brush and Floss:</strong> While it may seem counterintuitive,
gently brushing and flossing around the affected area can help dislodge
any food particles that may be contributing to the pain or inflammation.
Be very careful to avoid causing further irritation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:</strong> The best long-term strategy
for preventing toothaches and gum pain is consistent, good oral hygiene.
Brush your teeth twice a day, floss daily, and use an antibacterial mouthwash.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>3. When to See a Dentist</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>You should see a dentist if you experience:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pain that is severe or persistent</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Swelling in the gums, face, or jaw.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A fever.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A bad taste in your mouth,</strong> which could be a sign of an
abscess or infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Difficulty swallowing or breathing,</strong> which can be a sign
that an infection is spreading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pain when chewing.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Early diagnosis and treatment by a dentist can prevent the issue from
worsening and save your tooth. Many dentists allow walk-ins or next day
appointments, which may be superior than emergency department.</p>
