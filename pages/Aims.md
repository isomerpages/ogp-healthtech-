<p>S.T.A.R. aims to improve patient and provider experiences through the
following:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Reduce ED Waiting Times</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>By allowing patients to self-triage and be educated about their conditions,
S.T.A.R. right sites patients with non-emergency conditions that can be
seen by GPs or polyclinics, thus better distributing the patient load and
reduces ED waiting times</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent near misses of sick patients</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>ED wait times can be long, with peak periods reaching more than 8 hours
before patients are seen by a doctor. This creates a gap whereby patients
may deteriorate or become severely unwell while waiting to be seen. By
reducing unnecessary presentations, physicians are better able to prioritise
such patients and prevent near misses</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce Physician Burnout</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>ED physicians may see more than 20 patients in an 8 hour shift, which
not only limits the amount of time and attention they are able to give
to each patient, but increases the risk of burnout.</p>
</li>
</ul>
