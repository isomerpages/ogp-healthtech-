<h4>S.T.A.R. aims to improve patient and provider experiences through:</h4>
<p><strong>Right siting of patients</strong>
</p>
<p>By helping patients to self-triage and be educated about their conditions,
S.T.A.R. right sites patients with acute medical conditions to the optimal
care destination, ensuring they get the care they need.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Reducing ED overcrowding</strong>
</p>
<p>By getting patients with mild to moderate acute conditions to visit the
GPs or polyclinics instead of the ED, there is less ED overcrowding, resulting
in a better overall experience for ED patients.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Reducing Staff Burnout</strong>
</p>
<p>Reducing ED overcrowding and high ED workloads helps to reduce ED staff
burnout.</p>
