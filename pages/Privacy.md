<h3><strong>Serving You as a Part of the Public Healthcare Institution</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>As a public healthcare institution, our mission extends to serving the
wider community. To provide you with seamless care, we share necessary
information with other healthcare providers via secure national systems
like the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR). Your personal data may
also be used to invite you to suitable care programs or to be considered
for relevant research studies. Additionally, we contribute to national
health initiatives by participating in multi-agency efforts to refine healthcare
policies, improve patient safety, monitor disease outbreaks, and educate
the next generation of medical professionals. Rest assured that all these
uses and disclosures are carried out with the highest level of data protection,
in strict adherence to the PDPA and other relevant legislation, as we continuously
strive to enhance the quality of your care.</p>
