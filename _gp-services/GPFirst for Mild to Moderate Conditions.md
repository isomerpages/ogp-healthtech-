<p>The GPFirst programme encourages people with mild to moderate acute medical
conditions (See list below) to visit their GP first, rather than going
directly to the ED.</p>
<p>This enables EDs to focus on more urgent cases requiring medical attention
and allows patients with milder conditions to receive earlier treatment
by their GPs.</p>
<p>Residents receive a $50 subsidy on the prevailing ED attendance fee if
subsequently referred by a GPFirst GP to the EDs.</p>
<p>These GPs are able to make subsidised referrals for patients with CHAS
Cards to the specialist outpatient clinics as well.</p>
